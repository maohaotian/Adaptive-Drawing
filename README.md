## How to Play
1. Download the latest *sketchscape.apk* release from our [Releases](https://github.com/Marlo-Ong/sketchscape-vr/releases.) tab on Github.

3. Search for *Sketchscape* within the Apps screen of your headset and launch the executable.

## Background
- The user is placed in a stationary virtual environment.
- There are no methods of locomotion, since this experience is meant to be played standing in one spot.
- The user will use the controllers to simulate a paint brush and "paint" onto a canvas.
